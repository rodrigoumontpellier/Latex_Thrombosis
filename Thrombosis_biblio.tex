%\section{\label{sec:Haemostasis}Haemostasis}
%Haemostasis is the mechanism that respond to vascular damage in order to preserve vessel integrity. Haemostatic response depends in several interactions between the vessel wall, circulating platelets, blood coagulation factors, complement factors, leukocytes and the blood flow. Haemostasis can be seen as the mechanism that regulates the delicate balance of coagulation and anticoagulation activity. Bleeding and coagulations disorders are the result of an unbalance haemostatic response. For instance bleeding disorders like haemophilia or coagulation pathologies like thrombosis can present if haemostatic activity is not in equilibrium.\\
\section{\label{sec:Blood}Thrombosis in biomedical devices}
Coagulation is the biological process by which blood is transformed into a clot. The purpose of coagulation is to cease blood loss from a damaged vessel. When coagulation results into the stop of bleeding the process is called haemostasis. \citet{Hoffbrand:2011} defines the haemostatic system as a delicate balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms allied to a process for fibrinolysis. In a simple direct definition haemostasis is the assembly of processes that hold the blood in a fluid state inside the blood vessel. The five major components of haemostasis are: platelets, coagulation factors, coagulation inhibitors, fibrinolysis and blood vessels. These major components participate in the three stages of haemostasis: initiation, amplification and regulation. A simpler pedagogic division can be found in three stages: primary haemostasis (vasoconstriction, platelet adhesion and activation), coagulation and fibrinolysis. Haemostasis is triggered naturally when an injury is present at the vessel wall, however, it can also be caused by the interaction of blood with an artificial surface; for instance a medical device.\\ 
In medical practice the main concerns related to thrombosis when using medical devices are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Thrombosis deposition that can lead to device malfunction
\item Thromboembolism which leads to ischemic strokes, myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism.
\item Hemorrhagic stroke due to anti-coagulant or anti-platelet therapy 
\end{itemize}
Thrombus formation has been observed in several biomedical devices and clinical procedures like stents, grafts, cathethers, haemodialysis, bypass or in \nomenclature{\textbf{VDAs}}{Ventricular assist devices}% 
ventricular assist devices (VDAs). The probability of thrombus formation depends a lot on the procedure and on the device. For instance in stents implants \citet{Wilson:2013} thrombosis was reported to occur in only $1-2 \%$ of the patients. In endovascular grafts the American \nomenclature{\textbf{FDA}}{Food and Drug Administration}%
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported thrombus formation for $34.8\%$ of the patients; this value was found to be due to a manufacturing imperfection that induced high shear stress values and therefore platelet activation. \citet{Chan:2009} showed that the high shear stress induced during catheterization resulted in platelet activation which is relevant for several procedures for instance hemodialysis. In \nomenclature{\textbf{LVADs}}{Left ventricular assist devices}%
left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) implants, a particular trend was reported by \citet{Mehra:2014} showing an increase in thrombus formation causing mechanical failures of the devices. In the United States closed to $25 \%$ of patient hospitalizations are due to thrombus complications and result in a cost close to 1 billion of U. S. dollars per year. Considering a global scale optimizing medical devices to reduce the thrombus formation is an alternative to reduce hospitalizations cost and improve the service life of the biomedical devices. \\ 
In this section coagulation is presented paying close attention to thrombosis in biomedical devices. For the sake of understanding the normal in vivo coagulation process is presented. Variations due to biomedical devices are explained when convenient. 
\subsection{ \label{sec:chemical} Thrombosis: a chemical process}
Thrombosis is the pathological process that forms a clot inside a blood vessel. The key component in coagulation is thrombin. Thrombin is an enzyme that amplifies the cascade of reactions that lead to coagulation, it also regulates the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The haemostatic equilibrium between coagulants agonist and anticoagulants is broken when excessive quantities of thrombin are produced (hence thrombosis). Full non-thrombogenic  surfaces remain unavailable today. One reason of this is that the complicated coagulation process has not been fully understood. Several interactions between blood components, artificial surfaces, flow properties and different time scales make coagulation a difficult multi-physic problem. A general explanation of coagulation is presented bellow to understand each part of the haemostatic system and their interactions. For a deeper description of the haemostatic system one can refer to haematology textbooks for instance~\cite{Hoffbrand:2011}.\\
\subsubsection{Coagulation Cascade}
Coagulation proteins circulate in the blood in their inactive form. When an injury at the wall takes place, they are involved in a cascade of reactions that lead to coagulation and to thrombin formation. These reactions are known as the coagulation cascade which is conformed by two systems that converge into a common pathway. The intrinsic and the extrinsic system pathways converge into the common pathway to form fibrin clot.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{Figures/Furie.png}
\caption{\label{sec:fur} Vessel wall showing the collagen and Tissue Factor locations (image from \citet{Furie:2008})}
\end{figure} 
\paragraph{\underline{Intrinsic system (pathway):}}
In vivo the intrinsic pathway system is initiated by the exposure of collagen under the endothelium as in figure~\ref{sec:fur}. In particular when the endothelium is damaged, contact activation (activation by negatively charged surfaces) occurs. The importance of the intrinsic pathway remains speculative in vivo because of the difficulty to measure contact activation in the blood vessels. However, for in vitro cases, contact activation is always present thus initiating the cascade of reactions that lead to coagulation. A recent model of the intrinsic pathway for artificial surfaces was proposed by~\citet{Chatterjee:2009a}. Figure~\ref{sec:intrinsic_diagram} shows the intrinsic pathway including the three enzymatic reactions (auto-activation, auto-hydrolysis and reciprocal activation) that activate factor XII and begin the coagulation cascade in biomedical devices. At the artificial surface factor XII follows a surface mediated reaction to form factor XIIa (auto-activation). Also at the surface \nomenclature{\textbf{HMWK}}{High molecular weight kininogen}%
high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) binds to prekallikrein \nomenclature{\textbf{PK}}{Prekallikrein}%
 (PK) and to factor XI. Once PK is bind to HMWK it transforms into \nomenclature{\textbf{Kal}}{Kallikrein}% 
Kallikrein (Kal). Activation of factor XII by Kal and auto-hydrolysis of factor XII complete the three different mechanisms of factor XII activation. In addition Kal transform factor XIIa to XIIf (fragmented) which serves as a regulator of factor XIIa.\\
Factor XI is transformed to XIa by the presence of factor XIIa. Activated factor XI transform IX to IXa and diffuses, then factor IXa forms a complex with calcium and VIIIa (which is a result of the initiation of the extrinsic system). Subsequently complex IXa$\backslash$VIIa$\backslash$Ca activate factor X. The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways merge in the production of factor Xa. \\

\end{figure}
%The model of~\citet{Chatterjee:2009a} does not considers the adsorption process of proteins over the foreign surface. When an artificial surface is present in the blood flow; proteins (albumin, fibrinogen, factor XII, HMWK, etc) rapidly adhere to the artificial surface. This protein layer changes dynamically in what is called the Vroman effect \cite{Vroman:1980}. This effect explains that the protein layer evolves due to protein competition to adsorb to the artificial surface and thus the production of factor XIIa will be influenced by the rate of absorption of factor XII. Once factor XII adheres to the surface it is activated due to the three enzymatic reactions previously mentioned. 
\paragraph{\underline{Extrinsic system (pathway):}}
This pathway is triggered by the presence of \nomenclature{\textbf{TF}}{Tissue Factor}%
Tissue Factor (TF) which is present at the sub-endothelium (see Figure~\ref{sec:fur}), in leukocytes and  under some pathological conditions in monocytes. TF is also known as factor III or thromboplastin. When TF is exposed to blood flow, it binds to plasma factor VII to form the TF$\backslash$VII complex. TF $\backslash$VII complex promotes the activation of factor VII forming the complex TF$\backslash$VIIa. It is important to mention that pico-molar concentrations of VIIa circulate normally in the blood thus allowing, in the presence of TF, the direct formation of TF$\backslash$VIIa complex \citep{Gorbet:2004}. In the presence of calcium and phospholipids TF$\backslash$VIIa complex activate factor X, as pointed out before, here is where the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways come together. In addition TF$\backslash$VIIa complex can activate factor IX, hence communication between extrinsic and intrinsic systems take place. Figure~\ref{sec:extrinsic_diagram} shows a diagram of the extrinsic pathway.

\end{figure}
\paragraph{\underline{Common pathway:}}
Factor Xa forms a complex with activated factor Va. In the presence of calcium complex Xa$\backslash$Va converts prothrombin into Thrombin which is the master regulation of coagulation. Thrombin cleaves activation peptides from Fibrinogen to form fibrin monomers that result into a clot at the site of the injury. It also activates factor XIII that gives mechanical structure to the fibrin clot. In addition thrombin activates surrounding platelets that seal the fibrin clot. In order to form an amplification feedback loop, thrombin activates factor V, factor XI and factor VIII. Figure~\ref{sec:coagcas_diagram} shows the coagulation cascade involving the three pathways previously mentioned.\footnote{A really good graphical effort from the Johns Hopkins University to explain the coagulation cascade can be found in \url{http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/hematology/Coagulation.swf}}\\
\paragraph{\underline{Inhibitors of coagulation}}
As we have seen, the coagulation events are amplified by pro-coagulant activity, therefore a counterpart that slows down the coagulation reactions is present in blood in order to reach a balance. The main inhibitors of coagulation are: Protein C, Protein S, Antithrombin and \nomenclature{\textbf{TFPI}}{Tissue Factor pathway inhibitor}%
Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Protein C} is a vitamin K-dependent protein that inactivates factors Va and VIIIa.
\item \textbf{Protein S} is also a vitamin K-dependent protein that is a cofactor of protein C.
\item \textbf{Antithrombin} is contained in blood plasma, it neutralizes factor Xa and Thrombin by forming a complex with both enzymes (Xa and Thrombin), thus blocking the active site. It is also capable of inhibiting factors IXa, XIa and XIIa.\\
\item \textbf{TFPI} is the main inhibitor of TF$backslash$VIIa complex and factor Xa. TFPI is present on the lumminal surface of the vascular endothelium, also in platelets and plasma. At the time of their activation, monocytes can release TFPI.

\paragraph{\underline{Bio-material effects in coagulation pathways}}
In order to trigger the intrinsic system, contact activation by negative charged surfaces has to be present. This event is not confirmed in vivo. However in the presence of an artificial surface, an absorbed protein layer appears and the required negatively charge surface is present, hence initiation of the intrinsic pathway presented above. Furthermore TF expression by monocytes was observed by \citet{Wilhelm:1998} and correlated to the presence of bio-materials boosting the extrinsic pathway.
\pagebreak
%The time scales that are involved in the different bio-material effects on the coagulation cascade vary from seconds to minutes for the contact activation (negative surface) and some hours or minutes for the TF expression.
\subsubsection{Platelet activation}
Platelets act together with the fibrin plug in haemostatic process to preserve the integrity of the vascular wall. Normally non-activated platelets circulate in the blood flow and they become active in the first instants of haemostasis (in what is call primary haemostasis). Platelets are recruited to the injury in order to seal the fibrin clot; therefore they become a major component of the thrombus. Platelets become activated when contacting any type of thrombogenic surface, they play a critical role in the amplification of the coagulation cascade by providing a fundamental base in which reactions of coagulation can take place (we had referred to this base as a phospholipid surface). There exist two pathways to platelet activation \citep{Furie:2008}. One pathway is due to the interactions of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and glycoprotein VI with collagen; this pathway is independent of thrombin and its result is the adhesion of platelets to the site of injury. A second pathway for platelet activation is related to the extrinsic system which ends up in the production of thrombin. Thrombin activates platelets directly but it also produces serotonin and thromboxane $A_{2}$ that amplify platelet activation.\\
%Even though this second pathway is well recognized, a clear link with the recruitment of activated platelets to the injury site has not been observed. \\
In addition platelets can be mechanically activated by the flow. \citet{Hellums:1994} identify a shear stress threshold that depend on the stress exposure time.\\
\paragraph{\underline{Effect of bio-materials in platelets}}
Platelet activation has been observed in several clinical procedures and bio-mechanical devices. Once activated, platelets may attach to the wall vessel or be swept away by high blood flow rates. They also can form microemboli that flow in the circulation system. The bouncing off or adhesion of platelets to the thrombus is regulated by the interaction of GPIIb$\backslash$IIIa complex with fibrinogen and by the interaction of GPIIb$\backslash$IIa complex with vWF.\\
Another event that affect platelets takes place when artificial hydrophilic surfaces are exposed to normal plasma \underline{Vroman effect}. \citet{Vroman:1980} observed the replacement of fibrinogen in an attempt to identify the pathway of proteins deposited by plasma to artificial surfaces. The process that was used to track the proteins revealed an alteration in the fibrinogen deposited onto the surface. HMWK apparition and fibrinogen disappearance was observed when fibrinogen was deposited onto hydrophilic glass-like surfaces and put in contact with plasma. The process of fibrinogen alteration was clear when HMWK deficient plasma was used and the deposited fibrinogen remain unaltered. This event suggest that HMWK is the agent responsible of altering fibrinogen. The importance of the Vroman effect to platelets relays on the fact that platelets have a strong affinity to adhere with fibrinogen. For instance if a deficient HMWK plasma is present, platelets will interact with fibrinogen. 
\subsubsection{Complement system}
The complement system allows antibodies to kill some bacteria. This activity was said to "complement" the antibacterial activity of the antibody and hence the name. It has fundamental clinical implications in the context of life-threatening tissue injury and inflammation. In the last years an important relation of the complement system and the coagulation process has been observed.\\
Complement system is conformed by the classical and the alternative pathways see Figure~\ref{diag:complement}. The classical pathway is triggered by antigen-antibody complexes while the alternative pathway is activated by foreign surfaces such as fungal, bacterial polyssaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, particles and \textbf{bio-material surfaces}.\\

\caption{\label{diag:complement} Complement system diagram from \cite{Gorbet:2004} (Kirschfink M)}
\end{figure}
The complement system relates to the coagulation system in the form of a feedback loop. Thrombin and coagulation Factors XIa, Xa, IXa and plasmin were all found to effectively cleave C3 and C5 molecules which are central components of the complement system. In Table~\ref{tab:comple} all the interactions of the complement system with the coagulation systems are shown \citep{Gorbet:2004}.\\

\caption{\label{tab:comple}Interactions between complement and coagulation systems \cite{Gorbet:2004}}
\end{table}
\paragraph{\underline{Effect of biomedical devices in the Complement system:}}
\citet{Gorbet:2004} pointed out the importance to account for complement system interaction with the coagulation process when artificial surfaces are present. In particular an inflammatory response is observed in the presence of bio-materials. This inflammation is due to the complement activation by the alternative pathway. Interactions of the Factor H and the C3b molecule (see figure~\ref{diag:complement}) with the artificial surface trigger the complement system. In addition the complement activation by biomedical means has an important role in leukocyte activity meaning possible TF expression and therefore the initiation of the extrinsic system pathway.
\subsubsection{Leukocytes}
Several types of leukocytes are present in the circulatory system: neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils and eosinophils. Artificial surfaces interaction with Neutrophils($40-60 \%$ of leukocytes population) and monocytes ($5 \%$ of leukocyte population)  may be the reason of leukocyte activation. One of the most important effects of leukocyte activation to thrombosis is the expression and synthesis of TF. Leukocyte adhesion may also participate in inflammation (increasing the reactive surface) and therefore promoting the thrombogenic activity.\\
\paragraph{Biomedical effects of devices in Leukocytes activation}

\subsubsection{Blood flow influence in thrombosis}
Flow enhances the transport of coagulation factors (pro coagulants and inhibitors) to the surface (vessel wall injury or the artificial surface) and therefore is a crucial factor in the coagulation process. When it comes to the extrinsic pathway, it is found that for high shear rates the activation of factor Xa by the complex TF$\backslash$VIIa increases. \citet{Basmadjian:1997} showed the relation between the artificial surface reactivity and the flow. At low flow rates, activation rates of Factor IX (intrinsic system) are high and do not depend on  the surface reactivity. However, as the flow shear rate increases, the activation of factor IX depends a lot on the surface reactivity. This findings are really interesting because even when the activation rate of Factor XII is close to zero (almost anti-thrombogenic surface), the activation of factor IX continues. This supports the fact that the best way to design non-thrombogenic surfaces is to include both the reactivity of the tissue and the characteristics of the flow.\\
A clear influence of the flow in platelet activation, aggregation and adhesion is present \citep{Hellums:1994,Turitto:1975,Grabowski:1972}. Fluid mechanical shear stress can be pictured as a platelet agonist that will increase binding affinity between the different platelet agonists. Furthermore a clear interaction of platelet activation and shear stress has been observed at some particular threshold \nomenclature{\textbf{SS}}{shear stress}%
shear stress (SS) levels. Measurable changes in the platelet response are seen when the thresholds of SS are reached, these thresholds depending strongly on the time of exposure. Figure~\ref{diag:ssthreshold} shows the dependency of the platelet serotonin release (activation of platelets) to the shear stress and the exposure time. In particular a key event of the stress-induce activation and aggregation is the binding of vWF to platelet membrane glycoprotein Ib. Grabowski \textit{et al.} \citep{Grabowski:1972} demonstrated that increasing shear rate may increase the flux of platelets to a foreign surface not only by diminishing the thickness of the platelet concentration boundary layer but also by simultaneously augmenting the platelet diffusion coefficient; a dependency of the platelet adhesion to shear rate is therefore present.\\
In addition thrombus architecture is greatly influenced by how the fibrin plug and platelets adhere to thrombogenic surface, therefore the characteristics of the flow like wall shear or turbulence are extremely important to understand the dynamic process of thrombus formation.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{Figures/hellums_threshold}
\caption{\label{diag:ssthreshold}}
\end{figure}
Similar studies as for platelets have been done in order to evaluate the influence of the flow on leukocyte adhesion, suggesting an important connection; however a bigger effort needs to be done. Finally, turbulence may have an effect on the recirculation zones that result in hemolysis and cell activation but its influence in thrombus growth is poorly understood and research is still on going.\\
\subsubsection{Virchow's triad and coagulation tests}
There are several test and criteria that allow us to test the risk of thrombosis from a biomedical device. For instance Virchow's triad consist of three risk elements that build a criteria for venous thrombosis.
Virchow's components are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Slowing down of the local blood flow
\item Hypercoagulatibity of the blood
\item Vessel damage
\end{itemize}
Assessment of the biomedical devices needs to be performed in order to test the thrombogenicity. This test vary according the device and procedure in which the device will be use. In Table~\ref{tab:Thrombogenicity} several examples of device testing are presented.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\subsection{\label{sec:mechanical}Thrombosis Modelling}
The modelling of thrombosis can easily turn into complicated mathematical models, therefore an isolated analysis of each component of thrombosis may be easier and more clear to present. In this section the state of the art in thrombosis modelling is presented paying closed attention to the multi-physic nature of the problem.
\subsubsection{Biochemistry of intrinsic, extrinsic and common pathways}
One of the first models of thrombin generation was presented by Jones and Mann \citep{Jones:1994}. This model simulates the TF pathway (extrinsic pathway) including 18 species and 20 differential equations that describe the coagulation reactions. The model is solved using a Runge-Kutta integration technique.\\
A specific model of the intrinsic and common pathways was presented by \citet{Gregory:1994}. The model is comprised of 20 dominant reactions with 11 components that can be reduce to 4 coupled ODEs with Leveque's regime hypothesis. A polynomial algebraic equation can be obtained and 3 steady state concentrations for coagulants are analysed. The central coagulant in this model is Factor XII which was considered in 3 states (activated, bind to the surface and fragmented).\\
Another model of the intrinsic pathway was developed by \citet{Zarnitsina:1996}. In  this model 8 differential equations account for the activation of factors XI, IX, X, II, I, VIII, V protein C. Tenase and prothrombinase complex are calculated as a function of calcium concentration. The model assumes a constant flux at the injury site of activated factor XI.\\ 
\citet{Kuharsky:2001} developed a physical and chemical model that accounts for  platelet and coagulation events that occur in a thin layer, called the reaction zone, just above a small vascular injury. The KF model takes into account the plasma-phase, subendothelial-bound and platelet-bound enzymes and zymogens as well as activated and unactivated platelets. All species in the reaction zone are assumed to be well mixed; each species is characterized by its concentration that is tracked in time using an ordinary differential equation. Advective and diffusive transport of fluid-phase species (chemicals and platelets) into or out of the reaction zone is modelled by a mass-transfer term in which the mass-transfer coefficient depends on flow and diffusion parameters. The disadvantage of this model is the poor treatment of the flow.\\
In the work of Xu \textit{et al.} \cite{Xu:2008} a two dimensional model is presented where a macroscopic view of the flow is described by the NS equations. However, for the for the microscale interactions between the platelets and coagulation reactions, an extended stochastic discrete model was used.\\
Anand \textit{et al.} \citep{Anand:2003, Anand:2006, Anand:2008} biochemical reactions and rheological aspects are taken into account, in addition of reactions for the production of fibrin. The model of Anand \citep{Anand:2003} was used in a simplified way by Bodn\'{a}r and Sequeira \citep{Bodnar:2008} to study the clot formation and growth of thrombus in the vicinity of an injured vessel wall.\\
A mathematical model for the contact activation of factor XII by a pro-coagulant surface was developed by Guo \textit{et al.} \citep{Guo:2006}. The model of Guo uses a Michaelis-Menten kinetic mechanism simplifying the coagulation cascade of enzymatic reactions in a single enzymatic reaction. Therefore the model can be divided in two steps; first the activation of FXIIa as function of a catalytic surface potential (that variates according to the water-weattability of the surface) is calculated and then FXIIa interacts with the rest of the cascade of reactions in the form of a substrate. These two steps are combined to predict the coagulation time. Guo concludes that the material induced coagulation is a surface mediated event thus the coagulation times depends strongly on the surface area and the properties of the surface. Finally the results suggest that procoagulant surfaces have no influence in enzymatic reactions other than FXII activation
\subsubsection{Platelet activation and adhesion}
Sorensen \textit{et al.} \citep{Sorensen:1999} developed a two dimensional model of a coupled set of convection-diffusion-reaction equations, which attempts to simulate platelet-platelet and platelet-surface adhesion as well as platelet activation by relevant agonist (RP, AP, $a_{pr}$, $a_{ps}$). The model also accounts for platelet-phospholipid-dependent thrombin generation and thrombin inhibition by antithrombin III. The velocity fields come from the well know Poiseuille solution.\\ 
\citet{Mandrusov:1998} studied the Vroman effect in a shear flow chamber for a mixture of plasma and saline solution. Experiments were compared against numerical simulations to study the kinetics of plasma protein deposition. A band of fibrinogen moving downstream was observed and calculated. This band promotes platelet adhesion that was also observed in the experiments. A single-component unsteady convective-diffusion equation was solved for a two dimensional  domain. Deposition of fibrinogen and HMWK was calculated at the wall using the composition of the species. Natural convection had a great effect in the experiments, therefore, the experimental and numerical results showed important differences.\\
Fogelson and Guy \citep{Fogelson:2004} presented a model that account for platelet adhesion in an injured vessel using distributions of elastic links which generate stresses that influenced the fluid motion. This method is interested at the microscale of platelets events and considers the wall and the flow as a continuum.\\
A backward-facing step (BFS) configuration was studied by \citet{Taylor:2014}. In this work thrombus growth is investigated using an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The acrylic BFS configuration is connected to a pump in a closed loop in which bovine blood circulate for 90 minutes. Several MRI were performed to capture the thrombus growth and then simulations were performed with the segmentation geometry. The simulations where performed at a Reynolds number of 490 and the wall shear stress distribution over the thrombus was calculated observing a clear dependence on the thrombus topology. In an posterior work \citet{Taylor:2015} used a simplified form the model of Fogelson and Guy\citep{Fogelson:2004}. A modified Brinkman term was added to the equations in order to account for thrombus growth; This term act as a momentum sink in regions with a high concentration of platelet-platelet links. The advantage of this treatment is that it allows to keep the original mesh.\\
\subsubsection{Thrombus growth}
Goodman \textit{et al.} \citep{Goodman:2005} present a model in which thrombus growth is handled by increasing the viscosity in mesh cells where the volume of adherent platelets was grater than the volume of the grid. This model also takes into account embolization, platelet adhesion and platelet activation. Transport properties were taken as in \citep{Wootton:2002}. The model does not account for protein absorption it assumes proteins at the surface are in equilibrium. Finally the model of \citet{Goodman:2005} is compared with experimental results showing a good agreement for the thrombus growth.\\
Leiderman and Folgelson \citep{Leiderman:2011} present an extension of the Kuharsky and Fogelson \citep{Kuharsky:2001} model that incorporates spatial variations and explicitly models the growth of a thrombus and how this is coupled with the local fluid dynamics; the platelet adhesion is model as in \citet{Fogelson:2004}.\\
\subsubsection{Complement system activation}
\subsubsection{Leukocyte activation and TF expression}
\subsubsection{Thrombosis risk assessment in biomedical devices}
Biasetti \textit{et al.} \citep{Biasetti:2011} studied an unsteady blood flow in aneurysmatic aortas using a Newtonian and a non newtonian model for the blood using the $\lambda_{2}$ criteria for vortex-eduction. Then a possible relation between vortex and intraluminal thrombus (ILT) formation was investigated. In a posteriori work Biasetti \textit{et al.} \citep{Biasetti:2012} present a model in which biochemical reaction were added with a set of convection-diffusion-reaction equations from \citep{Jones:1994}. The results showed a big influence of the flow (shear rates and vortex) on the production of thrombin and the ILT growth.\\
In contrast, Achille \textit{et al.} \citep{Achille:2014} presented a predictor of intraluminal thrombus formation in abdominal aortic aneurysms using a chemistry-free approach. It mimics the platelets activation due to flow-induce shear and platelet adhesion at the walls where the haemodynamic activity is favourable (recirculation zones). Achille \textit{et al.} applied the model to 10 carotid arteries and 6 abdominal aortic aneurysms from which half of them where healthy. The results show an impressive effectiveness of the predictor; however more studies have to be done to include nascent thrombus that were not include in the study and that are crucial for medical practice.\\

\end{table}
As we can see from Table\ref{tab:recap} most of the models are focused on the extrinsic and common pathways thrombosis. Very few articles study thrombosis due to an artificial surface or in other words the intrinsic pathways. In addition complex flow configurations (which is the real case for biomedical devices) and activation of factor XII are not considered in the articles that study the intrinsic pathway \citep{Gregory:1994,Zarnitsina:1996,Mandrusov:1998,Chatterjee:2010,Kogan:2001}.\\ The role of turbulence and pulsate flows in platelet dynamics and coagulation pathways as well as the leukocyte expression of tissue factor and the complement system interactions with the coagulation cascade remain to be elucidated. In the next section two models to account for protein adsorption dynamics will be presented.
\subsection{Mathematical model for protein adsorption on artificial surfaces}
A mathematical model involving the initiation of the coagulation process and the dynamics of the flow remains absent in the literature. Most of the models consider a source of activated factor XIIa or a posterior activated factor. In order to investigate the contact pathway initiation in realistic flow regimes a kinetic enzymatic mechanism of factor XII activation can be couple in the form of a convection diffusion reaction equation communicating with the Navier Stokes equations.\\
\subsubsection{Convection diffusion reaction model}
One of the most common techniques to model thrombosis is the convection diffusion reaction model. This type of model considers a reaction network that is transported by a fluid in the form of diffusion and convection that yields to the following equation. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CDR}
\frac{\partial C_{i}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (C_{i}u)  = \nabla \cdot (D_{i} \nabla C_{i}) + R_{i}
\end{equation}
Where: \\
$C_{i} : $ Concentration of i species \\
$D_{i} : $ Diffusion coefficient \\
$R_{i} : $ Source or sinks of species i \\
The source terms are obtained from a enzymatic kinetic scheme. Then initial conditions of the species concentrations are given as an input (free flow concentrations or wall concentrations in the case of Factor XII). As we can see from equation~\ref{eq:CDR} the diffusion coefficients and the velocity field are as well inputs in the model. In our case the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid are solved to calculate the velocity fields.\\
A kinetic scheme of the intrinsic pathway can be used to investigate possible effects in the coagulation cascade due to the transport of enzymes. Two models for the activation of factor XII are presented. The first kinetical scheme was presented by \citet{Guo:2006} in which the catalytic potential is taken into account depending on the surface properties. A second scheme is taken from \citet{Chatterjee:2010} in which activation of factor XII is inhibited by two anti-thrombogenic enzymes  and a relations with the complement system are also present.
\subsubsection{Activation of Factor XII}
Up to date it is accepted that there are three enzymatic events that conduct to factor XII activation (auto-activation, auto-hydrolysis  and reciprocal activation of factor XII) as it is shown in figure~\ref{fig:activationFXIIa}.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/ActivationFXIIa.png}
\caption{\label{fig:activationFXIIa} Enzymatic reactions for activation of  factor XII from \citet{Chatterjee:2009a}}
\end{figure}
The second model presented is a portion of \citet{Chatterjee:2010} model that was used to predict the thrombin production in the absence of tissue factor suggesting that the possible mechanism for thrombin formation was activation of factor XII.

In addition to Table~\ref{Tab:Initial_Concentrations} the boundary condition at the wall for factor XII is $\frac{\partial C_{XII}}{\partial t} = 0$ thus the concentration of factor XII at the wall is constant and with a value of $C_{XII} = xxx$. The boundary condition for all the species at the bulk is $ \frac{\partial C_{i}}{\partial t} = 0$.\\
The model of \citet{Guo:2006} predicts the amount of FXIIa produced by a surface of pro-coagulant materials. In this model the pro-coagulant surface is model as an enzyme. Auto-hydrolysis is not taken into account because the production of activated factor XII is marginal next to the production due to auto-activation and reciprocal-activation. Another interesting aspect of this model is that a catalytic potential that takes into account wet-ability is included in the model.
The production of  factor XIIa due to auto-activation can be expressed in the form of a Michaelis-Menten mechanism that writes:
\begin{reaction}
XII + A <=>[k_1] (XII/A) ->[ k_2] XII_{a} + A    
\end{reaction} 
in which the FXIIa will be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FXIIaprodk2}
R_{XII_{a}} = \frac{k_{2} C_{XII} A_{0}}{k_{s}+A_{0}}
\end{equation} 
if $k_{s}$ is admitted to be the same across different pro-coagulant materials the product of $k_{2} C_{XII} $ can be expressed as a single constant $K_{1}$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:FXIIaprod}
R_{XII_{a}} = \frac{K_{1} A_{0}}{k_{s}+A_{0}}
\end{equation} 
which is the source term ($R_{XII_{a}}$) for equation~\ref{eq:CDR}, the variables used in the equations are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_{XII}$ concentration of Zymogen factor XII $\mu M$
\item $A_O$ initial surface area $m^{2}$
\item $K_{1}$ catalytic potential of the pro-coagulant material $\frac{\mu M}{min^{-1}}$
\item $k_{s}$ Michaeles Menten dissociation constant $m^{2}$
\end{itemize}
It is important to mention that the source terms must be added specifically at the artificial surface and not in the complete fluid domain. An interesting work perspective will be to add proper steps of the coagulation cascade until thrombin or fibrin production considering platelet activation by thrombin and due to the shear flow. Also by considering the effects of the shear flow, a criteria could be added for leukocyte expression of tissue factor due to high shear rates hence the amplification of the extrinsic pathway due to leukocyte expression could be study. Finally a kinetic model for the complement system could also be included to address the role of the complement system in thrombin production.
\section{Appendix Enzyme Kinetics}
\subsubsection{Enzymatic reactions}
In order to understand the source terms equation \ref{eq:CDR} a basic introduction to enzyme kinetics is presented. The complex behaviour of the enzymes present in blood flow can be analysed using basic chemical principles. The simplest enzyme mechanism that provides a description of individual chemical steps that make up the overall reaction can be explained as follows: substrate $S$ will be transformed into a product $P$ going through an intermediate step where a complex of enzyme $E$ and $S$ is formed: 
\begin{reaction}
E + S <=>[$k\sb{1}$][$k\sb{2}$] ES ->[$k\sb{3}$] P + E
\end{reaction}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item E - Enzyme 
\item S - Substrate
\item ES - Complex
\item P - Product
\item $k_{+1}$ reaction rate 
\end{itemize}
In order to advance step by step in the understanding of the previous kinetic mechanism a table with the different types of reactions is presented:\\
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
\hline
\textbf{Order} & \textbf{Production Rate} & \textbf{Equation} \\
\hline
first & rate = $k_{2} A  $ & $A \rightarrow B$ \\
second & rate = $k_{1} E S$ & $E + S \leftrightarrow ES $\\
Michaelis-Menten & $ \frac{k_{3} E_{t} S }{k_{m} S} = \frac{V_{m} S}{k_{m} + S} $ & $E + S \leftrightarrow ES \rightarrow P  $ \\
\hline  
\end{tabular}\caption{\label{tab:Enzyme} Enzyme reactions, $ k_{1}, k_{1}$ are in $s^{-1}$ whereas the units of $k_{2}$ are $s^{-1}$. $V_{m}$ is the maximum rate of reaction and $k_{m} = \frac{k_{2} + k_{3} }{k_{1}} $}
\end{table}

An important concept that needs to be include in the enzymatic reaction network is the competitive inhibition. This event occurs when the a substance resembling the substrate occupies the enzyme thus acting as a lock in the active site. This kind of locking is critical for haemostasis and thrombosis and needs to be taken into account in the reaction networks.\\
